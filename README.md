# To install the application on a production server from the development server:

1. On the production server launch these commands:

wget https://github.com/ericc06/P6-project/archive/master.zip  
unzip master.zip  
mv P6-project-master/* P6-project-master/.* .  
rm -r P6-project-master/  
rm master.zip

2. On the dev server, build the assets files for the production:

./node_modules/.bin/encore production

And transfer these files to the production server using FTP ou rsync.

3. On the production server:

  a. At this point, make sure that the Document Root of the web site is the root directory of the web site: check that no virtualhost is configured for the Document Root to be a subdirectory.
  
  b. Check that the Symfony requirements are OK:  
  https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/requirements.html
  
  c. Make a copy of the ".env.dist", call this copy ".env" and edit it this way:
  
-	APP_ENV=prod  
-	APP_DEBUG=0  
-	APP_SECRET: 32 random characters (letters & figures)  
-	In DATABASE_URL, enter a string of this form "mysql://mysql_login:mysql_password@mysql_server_IP:mysql_port_number/database_name" where:

o	mysql_login = MySQL user login (ex : root)  
o	mysql_password = this user's password  
o	mysql_server_IP = MySQL server IP address (ex : 127.0.0.1)  
o	mysql_port_number = MySQL server port (ex : 3306)  
o	database_name = database name
      
  d. Create the MySQL database manually and grant all privileges for the MySQL user configured in the ".env" file.
  
  e. Execute these commands:
  
  composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-scripts  
  composer require symfony/dotenv  
  php bin/console cache:clear  
  php bin/console doctrine:schema:create  
      
  f. Configure a virtualhost for the Document Root to be the "public" folder.
  
4. Through a web navigator, browse to this URL to initialize the hard-coded trick groups:  
https://<domaine>/trickgroups/init-list
  
==> The production server is ready to go!


# To configure a development environment, follow the previous steps, and add these ones:

1. Edit the "phpunit.xml.dist" file. On the following line:  
_env name="DATABASE_URL" value="mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/p6"/_  
insert the database connection details like in the ".env" file.
   
2. Run these commands to load the fixtures and perform the unit tests:

composer update  
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load  
php bin/phpunit  
    
==> If the unit tests are OK, the development environment is ready.
